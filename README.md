# ðŸ¤– twallet 

This script is a Telegram bot that helps track personal expenses. It is designed to run on Google Apps Script, a scripting platform for Google services. In particular, this script saves data directly to Google Sheets.

To test it:
- [Demo Telegram bot](https://t.me/demorip_bot)
- [Demo spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vqkkmkUpqK-Q-Xr_Ju6W0MFXdfYfdFrDr8ZY5QrwP8/edit#gid=0)
  

## Features

- **Initial Configuration**: initialize variables in parameters.gs such as the Telegram bot token, Google Sheets ID, WebAppa URL, and other configuration settings. You will also need to configure the `categories` object that contains the categories and expense sections.

- **Post request handling**: the `doPost` function is called when the bot receives a POST request from Telegram. This function analyzes the content of the request and sends the request to the appropriate handler based on the type of action (`callback` or `message`):
  - **Management of callback actions**: the `handleCallback` function handles actions associated with inline buttons on the Telegram keyboard (called callbacks). Depending on the type of callback, the code performs actions such as deleting an expense, selecting a category or section.
  - **Message handling**: the `handleMessage` function handles messages sent by users to the bot. Depending on the content of the message, the bot displays a welcome message, lists the available commands, starts the process of adding or deleting an expense, or handles the price entry of an expense.

- **Adding an expense**: when you select the button to add an expense, the bot displays the available categories. The user then selects a category and then a section. Finally, the bot prompts the user to enter the price of the expense and saves it in the spreadsheet.

- **Deleting an expense**: when you select the button to delete an expense, the bot displays the last 5 expenses entered and allows the user to select one to delete. Once selected, the bot deletes the expense from your spreadsheet.

- **Expense Summary**: The bot provides a summary of expenses by category and by month, showing the total amount of expenses for each category and for each month (and also the major frequency of categories and sections).

- **Language setting**: multilingual support is provided and it is possible to change the language of the bot. If you don't find your language and want to contribute open a pull request.

- **Secure access through ID control**: The bot is designed to allow only a specific user to interact with it, based on the user ID provided by Telegram and configured in `parameters.gs`.

   - Open Telegram and search for the `@BotFather` bot.
   - Start a chat with `@BotFather` and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
   - Follow the instructions and get the generated bot token. Save this token for later use.
   - Go to the Bot [getUserInfo](https://t.me/userinfobot) and retrieve your Telegram user id. Save this id for later use.

3. Add all the `.gs` files in this repo to Apps Script.
   - Open the Google Sheet created in step 1.

5. Save the WebApp URL generated.
   - After authorization, you will get a WebApp URL, like `https://script.google.com/macros/s/YourWebAppID/exec`. Save this URL for later use.

   - Open the `parameters.gs` script in the Apps Script editor.
   - Insert into variables `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `SHEET_ID`, `SHEET_NAME`, `USER_ID` and `WEBAPP_URL` the tokens/IDs saved in the previous steps. If necessary, edit the `TIMEZONE`.

7. Customize categories and sections.
   - Update the `categories` object in the `parameters.gs` script to customize the categories and sections according to your preferences.

8. Update App Script deployment.
   - In the Apps Script editor, go to the "Deploy" menu and select "Manage deployments."
